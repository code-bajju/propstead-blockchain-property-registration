Welcome to our property registration website, where we have leveraged blockchain technology to make property transactions secure, reliable, and transparent. Our platform is designed to provide a range of features that cater to the needs of both property owners and buyers, ensuring that all parties have a seamless and efficient experience.

To get started, simply log in using your private key provided on Metamask. Once you're logged in, you can navigate to the User or Land Inspector page, depending on your role.

### User
The 'User' page of our platform provides a range of options for property owners and buyers to manage their properties and transactions. With the 'Add Land' feature, you can easily add your property to the platform and start selling it. The 'My Land' feature allows you to keep track of all the properties you have posted for sale. The 'Land Gallery' feature is where you can browse through a range of properties posted by other users on our platform. If you receive any requests to buy your property, you can view them in the 'My Received Land Request' feature. Similarly, if you have placed any requests to buy other properties, you can view them in the 'My Sent Land Request' feature.

### Land Inspector

Our 'Land Inspector' page is designed to provide reliable verification services to all our users. With the 'Verify User' feature, you can easily verify the documents and details of any user on our platform. The 'Verify Land' feature allows you to verify the ownership and other details of the properties listed on our platform. And with the 'Transfer Ownership' feature, you can transfer the ownership of a property when it is bought and sold, all while ensuring that the transaction is secure and transparent.

### Bidding

Our 'Bidding' page is where users can auction and bid on properties listed on our platform. With the 'Sell Property' feature, property owners can start an auction for their property and receive bids from interested buyers. The 'Buy Property' feature allows buyers to browse through all the properties that are up for auction and place their bids. The 'Bidding History' feature keeps track of all the bids placed by you, providing complete transparency throughout the auction process.


### Real Estate Investment:

Our 'Real Estate Investment' page provides users with the opportunity to invest in properties by buying shares in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). This feature allows users to diversify their investment portfolios and gain exposure to the real estate market in a secure and transparent manner.



We hope our platform will help simplify the process of property transactions and provide a seamless and efficient experience to all our users. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact our support team who are available 24/7.
